    <h1>Obama Warfare</h1>
    <p>Obama warfare is a stupid little game made in python where you drone strike people. 
        You can download obama warfare by clicking <a href="assets/files/obamawarfare.zip" download>this</a> (551 KB).
        Though, due to the fact I wasn't able to compile it for some reason, you will require python installed to run it.</p>

    <p>The controls are pretty simple yet I have to make a section for them. W, A, S, and D to move your target overlay over a person. 
        It snaps on a grid, so don't worry if its only half on a person, you'll get them anyways. To fire the drone strikes, press the fire button.

    <h2 id="Winning">Win Conditions</h2>
    <p>If you eliminate all people with your drone strike weapon, you get a pop-up saying "you are true obama!" Congratulations, you won
        the game.<br><br><img alt="trueobama.png" src="assets/trueobama.png">
