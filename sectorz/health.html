        <h2 id="Basics">The Basics</h2>
        <p>The health system is quite easy to understand. First thing you should know, is that every injury has specific properties.<br>
            These properties define how serious a wound is, what is affected by the severity of the wound, and how likely you are gonna
            die. Injuries is a loose term but is still used for any effect or condition that the player is experiencing for simplicity.<br><br>
            Another big thing to know is that injuries either worsen or get better when left alone (with treatment or not, depends on wound).
            Most injuries will affect your overall vitality. Think of this as your health points, though just overly complicated for the sake
            of realism.
        </p>
        <h3 id="BasicProp">Basic Properties</h3>
        <ul style="padding-left: 1.4em;">
            <li><p>The <b>location</b> of an injury indicates where it is located, as different locations affect different things. For example,
                if you got a cut in your hand, you'd likely be fine and it would heal up fast and easy. Though, if you got a cut in your
                eye, you might not be able to see for a while. Now, understand that some injuries are non location-specific, and is 
                affecting the whole body.</p></li>
            <li><p>The <b>severity</b> or strength of an injury indicates how screwed you are, every wound has a specific line of
                effects that change depending on the severity. Though, this severity can decay or worsen depending on the injury.</p></li>
            <li><p>As stated like a second ago, the <b>rate of decay</b> says how much a condition worsens or decays in a specific amount of
                time. If it gets worse through time, maybe you should patch that up before you lose too much blood.</p></li>
            <li id="Pain"><p>You may ask, how do you determine if someone is unconscious... Well that answer is <b>pain</b>, it uses the same system
                as RimWorld does, where you have a certain pain threshold that determines when you fall. Most wounds give you a good
                amount of pain. And your pain threshold is increased by 10 pain units for every vitality point above 0 (with a base
                pain threshold of 80).</p></li>
            <li><p>Some injuries will be mostly hidden to the players (like blood loss), because of this, most wounds/injuries are given 
                a symptoms (aka visual or feeling effects) that can help you determine what this hidden wound is. <b>Diagnosing</b>
                is done by an Intelligence check (described below), high difficulty diagnosis can result is misdiagnosing!</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>As mentioned above, diagnosing is decided by an Intelligence check. Though not just diagnosing is dictated by this, medical
            procedures is also dictated by this. Luckily, you don't have to do it every time (unless you want to, in case you believe
            you've misdiagnosed yourself) as you remember things (amazing, never knew that). These memories are stored in the other section
            of your character sheet. Remember, a lot of things are common knowledge, and are by default already remembered (unless you have
            amnesiac detriment).</p>

        <h2 id="Healing">Fixing Your Broken Bones</h2>
        <p>Certain items fix certain injuries, some injuries have multiple fixes, ranging from how effective, and other stuff worsen the
            injury. If you wanna see the medical items, visit <a href="baseitems.html#Medical">this</a>.</p>
        
        <h2 id="Injuries">Injuries</h2>
        <p>Don't forget that these aren't all injuries, some are either hidden or improvised (aka situation where I didn't think this would
            require this injury). Though, a lot of injuries have secret properties (like visual effect) that'll usually require a diagnosis to
            figure out. (Caution: You may know in real life these properties, but remember your character has a seperate mind to yours.)
