    <h2 id="CharacterSheet">Character Sheet</h2>
    <p>Here is a picture of the base character sheet used:</p>
    <img alt="charactersheet.png" src="../assets/sectorz-sheet.png" width="623" height="384">
    <p>In a player's case, they would copy this and edit the individual fields accordingly.
        Or your DM could provide something like a
        <a href="https://forms.gle/yqUnjMvadiGfsXLJ9">google form if you are lazy.</a>
        Let's explain some of these fields.
    </p>
    <ul style="padding-left: 1.4em;">
        <li><p><b>Name</b> - Your character's name, can be anything but make sure to listen to your
                DM about naming conventions before you fill this out. (I don't have any.)</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Previous Occupation</b> - Your character's job before their boss
                was horribly mutilated by a zombie. You should base your attributes and
                starting inventory around this.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Inventory</b> - What your character starts with, this is both chosen by
                you, and the commonly by the detriment you got.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Character Description</b> - Your general description of how your
                character looks, good for other players, roleplay, and etc.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Nutrition</b> - Leave this blank as you are filling out your stuff.
                It'll come in play once you begin your first session.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Other</b> - A place to enter other miscellaneaous
                things like known languages, and etc. Not required.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Attributes</b> - Your stats, how well you perform on specific tasks,
                etc.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Health</b> - This is where you write your in-game injuries, conditions, and
                detriments.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="Attributes">Attributes</h2>
    <p>Your attributes dictate how well you perform certain actions and conditions. Here are the basic attributes. (The
        DM can branch off
        attributes into skills, but I won't be doing that for simplicity.)</p>

    <ul style="padding-left: 1.4em;">
        <li><p><b>Vitality</b> <img alt="vitality.png" src="../assets/vitality.png" width="20" height="20"> - 
            Similar to the Dungeon & Dragon's Constitution attribute, this dictates how
            healthy you are, how well you can hold against poisons, diseases, etc. For every point above 0, 5 extra max health is 
            added, and vice versa for every point below 0.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Strength</b> <img alt="strength.png" src="../assets/strength.png" width="20" height="20"> - 
            This is involved in actions like lifting heavy objects, holding doors closed, melee combat (with blunt objects),
            and more. This also adds 10 lbs. to your <a href="#Inventory">carrying capacity</a> for each point above 0, 
            but only removes 5 lbs. for each point below 0.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Dexterity</b> <img alt="dexterity.png" src="../assets/dexterity.png" width="20" height="20"> - 
            This is very similar to the Dungeons & Dragon's Dexterity attribute, this is involved
            in many things including melee combat (with non-blunt objects), dodging attacks, how fast you run, etc.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Perception</b> <img alt="perception.png" src="../assets/perception.png" width="20" height="20"> - 
            How well you use your senses to indentify your surroundings. 
            <i>THIS IS NOT A LUCK STAT FOR SEARCHING FOR ITEMS.</i></p></li>
        <li><p><b>Intelligence</b> <img alt="intelligence.png" src="../assets/intelligence.png" width="20" height="20"> - 
            Use ya brain. Other stuff like memory, history/context, and etc. tie into this too. The DM may also
            allow players to roll a Intelligence check to potentionally get a hint or pointer to something.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Players are given 12 attribute points which they may divide across the attributes anyway they please (though each attribute
        has a max of 4 points allowed to be alloted to it.) If players wish to get better stats they can gamble their way
        by purchasing an attribute point gamble in the character shop. (Though, this has the possibility to backfire around
        minus 1 point from the selected attribute, and you can't go back after a failure.)</p>
    <p>After everything is selected, you add the amount of points in the attribute
        relating to the check to the resulting dice roll on attribute checks. (This is called your <i>attribute modifier</i>.)</p>

    <h2 id="Inventory">Inventory</h2>
    <p>Inventory is based around weight (in lbs.), every character starts out with a carrying capacity of 15 lbs. (without any sort of bag, box)
        Base carrying capacity can be increased or decreased with your strength attribute. The use of bags, boxes, backpacks, or any container 
        can increase your carrying capacity.</p>
    <p>Along with that, you start with a starting inventory based on your 
        <a href="#Detriments">detriments</a> and what you chose in the <a href="#CharacterShop">character shop</a>.</p>
    <p>You can find all the base game items 
        <abbr title="Work in progress page"><a class="wip" href="baseitems.html">here</a></abbr>.</p>
    
    <h2 id="Detriments">Detriments</h2>
    <p>Detriments are permanent injuries, diseases, conditions, etc. This system is not required but brings an extra spice to gameplay.
        (I will be using this.) A spinner is spun or a die (with a really specific number of sides) is rolled, deciding what This
        detriment is.</p>
    <p>Detriments range from bad to extremely bad. For example, <a href="#Asthma">asthma</a> to <a href="#Blindness">blindness</a> (the worse detriment, the rarer it is). 
        Of course, you'll be given extra starting items relating to whatever detriment you got as compensation.</p>
